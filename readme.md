# Match-N-Match Testing

This is what I'm starting with for my match-n-match. The testing framework is adapted from [42framework](https://github.com/alamit/42framework), written by Adrien Lamit. All the integer unit testing source required for this project is included and the build.sh script will compile to "test". I've included code that demonstrates how it works.
